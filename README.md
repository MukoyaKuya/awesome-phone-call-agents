# MedRoute — CALL-E Hackathon Entry

MedRoute turns a frustrating phone-bound task into a safe, structured workflow: with the user's authorization, it calls selected pharmacies to check a medicine's availability, approximate price, pickup readiness, and closing time—then ranks the responses into a clear shortlist.

It deliberately does **not** provide medical advice, share patient details, place orders, or reserve medication. A licensed clinician or pharmacist remains responsible for medicine suitability.

## Why this matters

For time-sensitive medicine, online inventories are frequently incomplete and a patient or caregiver may spend hours calling pharmacies one by one. MedRoute gives care coordinators, family caregivers, and community-health organizations a consent-first way to gather the same facts in parallel.

## CALL-E integration

The live path imports `@call-e/calle` and calls `CalleClient.calls.createAndWait()` with an explicit recipient and schema that produces structured, comparable results. The exact task prompt constrains the agent to factual availability checks and requires it to identify itself.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. By default the app is in **demo mode**, which produces deterministic mock call results and never contacts anyone.

For hackathon judging, the operator-token field is prefilled with `medroute-demo`. This documented token is accepted only in local development when `CALLE_API_KEY` is not configured, so judges can run the safe demo immediately after `npm start`. It cannot authorize live calls and is never accepted in production.

To place live calls, configure both a valid server-side `CALLE_API_KEY` and a long random `MEDROUTE_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `.env` or `.env.local`. Enter the latter in the operator-token field; it is kept only in browser session storage and sent as a Bearer token for API requests. The server refuses to start with a live CALL-E key but no private operator token.

Recipients may be in any CALL-E-supported country and must use international E.164 format, such as `+12025550123` or `+254700000001`. By default CALL-E infers routing from the number; deployments may set `MEDROUTE_CALL_LOCALE` and `MEDROUTE_CALL_REGION` when explicit hints are required. The server requires both consent acknowledgements and a stable `Idempotency-Key` header before it will place a live call. The browser creates this key for each deliberate live submission; integrations must retain it when retrying the same request.

The default production safeguards allow 30 checks per minute per operator/IP, enforce a 15-minute per-pharmacy live-call cooldown, and allow crashed idempotency reservations to be retried after 15 minutes. Configure `MEDROUTE_MAX_CHECKS_PER_MINUTE`, `MEDROUTE_LIVE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`, `MEDROUTE_IDEMPOTENCY_PENDING_SECONDS`, `MEDROUTE_MAX_TRANSCRIPT_TURNS`, and a stable `MEDROUTE_RECIPIENT_HASH_KEY` for the deployment. Idempotency records are persisted with local history, but a multi-instance deployment should use the PostgreSQL/OIDC production mode for transactional cooldown reservations, managed identity, and audit logging.

## Production deployment

Set `MEDROUTE_ENV=production` to require PostgreSQL and OpenID Connect. In this mode the service will refuse to start unless `DATABASE_URL`, `MEDROUTE_OIDC_ISSUER`, `MEDROUTE_OIDC_AUDIENCE`, and `MEDROUTE_OIDC_JWKS_URL` are configured. PostgreSQL stores completed runs, idempotency reservations, pharmacy cooldowns, and an audit trail. OIDC access tokens replace the development-only shared operator token; use a provider-managed identity and restrict its audience to this service. Tokens also need `medroute.read` in `scope`, `scp`, or `roles` to read history, analytics, or transcripts, and `medroute.live` to place live calls; the permission names can be changed with `MEDROUTE_OIDC_READ_PERMISSION` and `MEDROUTE_OIDC_LIVE_PERMISSION`. Saved records are private to the token's stable `sub` claim. Existing database rows created before ownership support have no owner and are intentionally excluded until an administrator explicitly migrates them.

If a call starts but its result cannot be persisted, its idempotency reservation is retained with an `unknown` status. Do not release or reuse that key, and do not retry the calls under a new key. An administrator must reconcile the provider's call record with the database and then mark the reservation complete or explicitly release it.

Completed live calls preserve CALL-E's returned transcript turns alongside the results. Each live pharmacy result with a transcript has a **Download call transcript PDF** button; the same download remains available when opening the saved result later. The authorized pharmacy list is stored locally in the browser, while completed check history is saved server-side in the local `data/` directory.

## Safety and privacy

- Use only authorized pharmacy phone numbers in international E.164 format.
- Do not enter patient names, diagnoses, prescription identifiers, payment data, or other personal health information.
- No ordering, holding, payment, or clinical recommendation is permitted.
- Demo numbers are fictional international examples formatted only to exercise the validation path.
- Keep credentials server-side; `.env` is ignored by Git. Phone numbers are masked in responses, saved history, and transcript PDFs.

## Demo script (3 minutes)

1. Introduce the real bottleneck: caregivers calling pharmacies one at a time.
2. Enter a medicine and show the explicit authorization gate.
3. Run the safe demo and compare the ranked, schema-shaped results.
4. Show `server.js` and explain the real CALL-E `createAndWait` call plus result schema.
5. Close on boundaries: no medical advice, no PHI, no purchase, always transparent and consent-based.

## Submission checklist

- [ ] Replace demo pharmacies with authorized test recipients for the recorded live-call segment.
- [ ] Record and publish a ~3-minute demo video.
- [ ] Add this app under `apps/typescript/medroute/` in a fork of `CALLE-AI/awesome-phone-call-agents` and open a PR.
- [ ] Add the PR URL, video, and CALL-E account email to Devpost.
